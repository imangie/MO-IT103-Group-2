 * - Use this for creating the View Employee Window and its corresponding button (in the Employee List)

 * - you can copy and paste the "add_employee.fxml" file, just remove the "add" and "cancel" button, and its functionalities
 * - since this is strictly for viewing Employee Information only
 *
 * - Logic: when the user clicks on an employee in the table view, they can click on the "View Employee" button
 * - which will open a window showing their entire information
